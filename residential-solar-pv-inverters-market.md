<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar PV Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>String Inverters</li><li>Micro Inverters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential solar PV inverter market features two primary types: string inverters and micro inverters. String inverters connect multiple solar panels in a series, converting DC to AC power from the entire array, making them cost-effective and easy to install. In contrast, micro inverters operate individually on each panel, optimizing energy production and enhancing performance in shaded conditions. This allows for increased energy yield and system monitoring at the panel level, making them suitable for complex roof layouts.</p></p>
